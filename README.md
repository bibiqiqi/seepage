# Seepage

This is somewhat of a content management system that I made for an art collective called Seepage, for curating and exhibiting art.

Because it is a site for managing content, there are two sides to it, the "user" side acts like a living gallery of curated content that can be viewed by anyone. It can be accessed [here](https://seepage.herokuapp.com/).

**The user** can access the current gallery of artwork via two methods. They can either browse via a "tag map" that renders each art piece as a node within a web that relates to other art pieces via "tags" or words.

Alternatively, they can search the gallery of artwork via a keyword search box. Furthermore, they can then browse by click on any of the tag words that are listed within those results to display other search results.

**Members of the art collective** will be able to login to the "editor" side of the application [here](https://seepage.herokuapp.com/editor-login), where they can manage the content that will be displayed on the "user" side of the application.
